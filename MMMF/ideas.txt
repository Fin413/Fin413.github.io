******** IDEAS ********

    YOU HAVE MONEY AND STUFF
    YOU SAVE/INVEST IT 
    THEN AS IT MOVES FORWARD IT SHOWS HOW YOUR MONEY GROWS

    GIVE OPTIONS LIKE SPEND 5 DOLLARS A WEEK ON COFFEE OR SAVE IT
    SHOWS HOW MUCH YOU GAINED OR LOST BASED ON YOUR CHOICES

    ask how much a week they spend on non important stuff 
    then like do the shit 

    make it only a week then fast FORWARD


    give them allowance

    ****** give them a store at the end to see how they can spend thier money ******


    - money game?
    - little piggy bank mascot
    - some sort of information modules (whats the incentive for kids to do them tho?)

    UNLIKE GALACTIC GAINZ THIS SHIT ISN'T FOREVER
    give them a set amount of knowlege and teh ability to complete it 

    a little piggy bank charater trying to reach some objective
    you have to use knowlege of money and finalchial shit
    little challenges or minigames until you reach the end?


    OOO like a papa bakeria game or smth?



    WHAT DO I WANT TO TEACH THEM?
        how to spend money responsibily

        how im depth should i go?
        basics or more???


        MAKE MULTIPLE LEVELS LIKE START BASIC AND GO UP FROM THERE

    

    INCENTIVE

    allow them control, make them feel like their in charge of learning
    give them inputs
    things to do kinestetically
    bright flashy colors
    acheivements 
    things that track thei rprogress and make them want to come back



    When a child feels controlled, or out of control when it comes to their education, 
    they often withdraw from learning. ... The more control and input you're able to 
    provide a child, with respect to their learning environment, activities, and style, 
    the more engaged and motivated a child will become to learn.
