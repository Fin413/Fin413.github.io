        <h1 class="heading">About the Event</h1>
        <p class="paragraph">Paper Mario Day is an annual international holiday taking place on March 22nd. Every year on this day, twitch streamer Atrioc <span style="white-space: pre;">(<button class="linkBtn" onclick="showOverlay()">click here to see full name</button>)</span> plays the game Paper Mario on stream. Chatters come from far and wide to witness the spectacle of critical acclaim, often skipping work, school, or even funerals to be able to say "I was here." With riveting voice acting and non-stop action, it's easy to see why Paper Mario Day has gone down in history as the most illustrious day of the year.</p>
